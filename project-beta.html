        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Designed and implemented an SQL database for a fictional airline to manage flights, passengers, bookings,aircraft, and employees. The database includes multiple tables with defined relationships, primary and foreign keys, and constraints to ensure data integrity.  The database also has queries to retrieve information such as flight schedules, passenger manifests, and booking histories, and is practiced using joins, aggregations, and subqueries to answer complex questions.</p>
